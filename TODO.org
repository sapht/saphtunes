currently album_match_song_list loops through all songs, then does a
dirent_list of the album root repo, then tries to match the origin of
those songs with the corresponding origin of every dirent found in the
root repo that contains a .git/config.

this is bad, instead loop through all songs (which should have their
origin already loaded via git_load_config), then look at each album,
parse the .gitmodules and aqcuire a char** of submodule origins, then
compare the origins.

Screens per different views, one is only songs, one is albums, one is
album/song, one is something else.

There's a seemingly simple example for this in the cdk examples.
** Split view

Look for library functions. Otherwise, one could perhaps LINES or
COLS or some other brutaly invasive ncurses feature.

traverse_ex has some aligning to it.

There's a nice text viewer/scroller in the examples. If I need to view
big amounts of text, this could be useful.

CDK widgets seem to be embeddable within ncurses in some manner;
there's an example for this.
